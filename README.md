Simulate 2D Top Down RPG using Kivy Textures

Kivy 1.11.1
Python 3.7.7

Will work if git clone'd and main.py is executed.

How do I blit data onto an existing texture keeping the rgba values that already exist and overlaying new bytecode without overwriting. Note the tree image's white areas are transparent.

GOAL: Trees that "blend" into each other

ISSUE: Trees are overwriting each other, although their white space is transparent
