Simulate 2D Top Down RPG using Kivy Textures

Kivy 1.11.1
Python 3.7.7

How do I blit bytecode onto an existing texture keeping the rgb values that already exist and overlaying new bytecode without overwritting?

The issue to be solved is how to blit bytecode onto a single texture without the overwritting existing bytcode. See below

GOAL: Trees that "blend" into each other

ISSUE: Trees are overwriting each other, although their white space is transparent
